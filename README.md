# Gaming Platform SQL Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates various SQL operations using a **gaming platform dataset**. The dataset includes tables for **Users**, **Games**, **Purchases**, and **Reviews**. The project covers basic to advanced SQL queries, showcasing data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, and manipulation techniques.

## Dataset Structure
The database consists of four main tables:

1. **Users**: Stores information about users (e.g., username, email, age, join date).
2. **Games**: Contains details about games (e.g., title, genre, price, release date).
3. **Purchases**: Tracks purchases made by users (e.g., user ID, game ID, purchase date, amount paid).
4. **Reviews**: Stores reviews and ratings given by users for different games (e.g., user ID, game ID, rating, review text).

## SQL Queries Covered
The project includes a variety of SQL queries, including but not limited to:

- **SELECT Queries**: Retrieve data from tables.
- **JOIN Operations**: Combine data from multiple tables using INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN.
- **WHERE Clauses**: Filter data based on specific conditions.
- **Aggregations**: Use functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX for data summarization.
- **GROUP BY & HAVING**: Group data and filter aggregated results.
- **ORDER BY & LIMIT**: Sort and limit query results.
- **INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE**: Perform data manipulation operations.
- **Advanced Queries**: Complex queries combining multiple clauses and conditions.

## Key Features
- Comprehensive SQL query examples ranging from basic to advanced levels.
- Real-world scenario simulation through a gaming platform dataset.
- Hands-on practice with essential SQL concepts and operations.

## How to Use
1. **Set up the database**: Import the provided SQL script to create and populate the `gaming_platform` database.
2. **Run the queries**: Execute the included SQL queries to explore the dataset and perform various operations.
3. **Modify & Experiment**: Feel free to adjust queries, filter conditions, and join types to deepen your understanding of SQL.
